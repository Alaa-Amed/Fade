            <p>
                To build the circuit, I used:
                <ul>
                    <li>1 push button</li>
                    <li>1 10k Ω resisto</li>
                    <li>1 330 Ω resistor</li>
                    <li>1 red LED</li>
                    <li>9V battery </li>
                    <li>Arduino board </li>
                    <li>some wire</li>
                    <li>2 alligator clips (for the heart)</li>

                </ul> 
                </p>

            <p> <br><b>Why add a resistor when using a push button?</b> <br>
                It turns out there is electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by external forces all around us. <br>EMI makes it hard to get a consistent value reading from the pins. This is known as floating pins.<br> If we were to connect a push button to a pin on the Arduino board without a resistor, we would get <br> random readings when the push button is left unpressed. <br>
                <br>  
                
            <img src="random.gif" width=600></a> <br>
            <br>

            There are two ways of connecting the resistor:
            <ol>
                <li>Pull-up </li>
                <li>Pull-down </li>
            </ol>
            I chose to use the pull-down way by connecting the resistor to ground so that when the button is not pressed <br> I get a reading of zero and when it’s pressed I get a reading of 1. The reason that happens is electricity likes <br> to travel the path with the least resistance, meaning when the circuit is complete the electrons would encounter <br> the resistor and chose to go the other path giving me a reading of 1.

            <b>Making it a little more interesting...</b> <br>
            I cut an acrylic sheet in the shape of a heart using a laser cutter. I taped a red LED to one side. <br> I connected the positive leg of the LED to pin 6 and the negative leg to the 320 Ω resistor. <br> The value  of the resistor was determined by using Ohm’s law.

            <p>
            Now when I press the button the heart fades on and then off untill the button is pressed again.
